Hello Reader, thanks for clicking on my blog! My name is Simon Heitin and I've been a professional data scientist for 7 years. My academic and career journey has taken me from pure mathematics to systems engineering to operations research to data science. 


The name for the blog, "Names Are Hard," is a nod to the blinking cursor moment when you are compelled to summarize a piece of work in a single word or phrase. In coding, this moment is ubiquitous as it arises each time you create a variable, start a new project, or save a file^[or start a blog...hypothetically.]. You want the name to be clear but also short so that it is easy to type. You want it to be specific so that it accurately characterizes its contents, but you also want to leave space for generalization and reusability^[oh how satisfying to wrap up repeated code in a meaningful function]. 

Good names have the illusion of having appeared effortlessly. "Of course you would name it that, what else in the world would you name it?" And yet, naming well usually requires a good deal of thought and often a willingness to rename and rework. So, when the cursor starts blinking, remember to take a moment to acknowledge that you confront a difficult and important task because Names Are Hard.
